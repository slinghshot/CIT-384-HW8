                <h2>DevOps Engineer</h2>
                <p>I have had the privilege of gaining hands-on experience in various roles,
                    each of which has taught me invaluable skills and contributed to my growth as a professional. As a
                    DevOps Engineer at ATIMS, I have been responsible for deploying and operating software systems and
                    infrastructure components in AWS GovCloud regions. I have also worked as an IT Consultant, helping
                    businesses with their infrastructure and workflow. In addition, my time at LAUSD Polytechnic H.S.
                    allowed me to manage and troubleshoot technical issues and develop software using C#, Python, and
                    MySQL.
                    I am grateful for my experience as a CyberPatriot Instructor with Keep Youth Doing Something (KYDS),
                    where I had the opportunity to teach cybersecurity skills to students. Currently pursuing a BS in
                    Computer Information Technology with a minor in Management at California State University,
                    Northridge. I
                    have had the honor of competing in the Fall 2021 National Cyber League Competition, ranking 98th
                    percentile in individual competition. I am eager to continue growing my skills and making meaningful
                    contributions to any team I am a part of.</p>
